## Table of Contents
### Introduction
This dataset contains information of several thousand movies including budget, revenue, cast, and genre. The research will explore the following interesting questions: 
> 1) Which genres are most popular from year to year?
> 2) What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have the highest-grossing movies?

### Data Wrangling
Check for cleanliness, and then trim and clean the dataset for analysis. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions posed in the Introduction section. 

### Conclusions
Finally, summarize the findings and results that have been performed. 

### Limitations
Describe any limitations in the input data. The sample must be good enough to represent the population so that the analysis will have enough data to generalize the entire population.
